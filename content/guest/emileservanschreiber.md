Dr. Emile Servan-Schreiber is a cognitive scientist and entrepreneur specializing in business and political applications of prediction markets and other collective intelligence technologies. His latest book on the topic was published in France by Fayard (Paris) in 2018: "Supercollectif - la nouvelle puissance de nos intelligences"

Since 2000, as a founder of Hypermind, he has pioneered many business applications of prediction markets for dozens of leading companies on all continents (except Antarctic). Since 2012, Hypermind has participated in several IARPA research programs about crowd-based and hybrid forecasting systems.

He holds degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics as well as a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from Carnegie Mellon and in 2019 joined the international faculty of the UM6P School of Collective Intelligence, the first of its kind in the world, where he is teaching a graduate course in crowd-based forecasting.

His work on prediction markets has been featured in the best-selling book The Wisdom of Crowds, as well as in leading print media such as The New York Times, The Economist, The Financial Times, BusinessWeek, Time, Newsweek, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, Nature, Le Figaro, Le Monde, Le Point, L'Express, La Tribune, Liberation, and Volkskrant.
