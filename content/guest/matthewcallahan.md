Matt has always been fascinated by the power of storytelling. At an early age he applied this fascination to performing, and got his B.F.A. from The Theatre Conservatory at Chicago College of Performing Arts. This led to award-winning career onstage in musical theatre, spanning almost a decade of national tours and shows in New York, Chicago, Toronto, and beyond.

Eventually Matt’s love of writing, technology and design got the better of him, and he founded two startups that turned into thriving companies — a creative agency, and an e-commerce board game concept. 

He's now a Creative Director at VaynerNFT, which is bringing the world of non-fungibles to the world's largest brands.
