Rory Trifon is the President of the Estate of Richard Bernstein. While Richard Bernstein is most widely remembered today as the creator of Andy Warhol’s Interview Magazine distinctive covers, since the mid 60s he was one of the pioneers and architects of Pop Art. One of the first artists to blur the line between commercial and fine art, Bernstein’s technicolor work (whether on canvas shown in a gallery or a magazine cover at a newsstand) captured the glamour, extravagance, and innovation of the Pop Art era. 

His works are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Portrait Gallery, Stedelijk Museum, Hirshhorn Museum and has had exhibitions at the Iris Clert Gallery , Gallerie Barozzi, Byron Gallery "The Box Show," among others, most recently exhibited at The Deitch Gallery, Whitney Museum, The Brooklyn Museum, Nottingham Contemporary and upcoming Warhol Museum exhibition September 2022.
