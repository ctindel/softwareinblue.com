Brad Murdoch is what is euphemistically known as a “software industry veteran", meaning that he is able to bore you to death with tales about life in the tech industry prior to the internet.

Brad's career was shaped early on by his epic failure as a software engineer at Hewlett Packard. His boss told him that "when it comes to software, you're better talking about it than writing it”, so he embarked on trying everything else in the industry to see what would stick, including marketing, product management, professional services, business development, corporate strategy and bunch of management roles. Very germane to our podcast, two years as an enterprise sales guy doing his own pre-sales left him permanently scarred.

Since 2004, Brad has worked for 6 startups and is currently Executive Vice President of Strategy and Product at Lightbend, the company behind Akka, the open source distributed computing framework. You might not be aware of it but you probably used Lightbend software today if you ordered a Starbucks, watched Disney+, played Fortnite, checked your LinkedIn feed or are listening to this podcast on Spotify.  Brad is also on the Board of Permission.io, where users truly own their data and get paid crypto for sharing it.
