Description = "Are Sales Reps still needed? Should Sales Reps and SAs have a variable commission plan? Eric Heikkila, who formerly led all of GTM/Sales for AWS Databases Globally, is now the GTM leader for the hot new serverless data caching starting Momento. He sat down with us to really geek out about how they're approaching the sales motion given that they can start from scratch and aren't weighed down by existing legacy sales structure and process. Listen to see how he answers these questions, and many more like product-led vs. sales-led growth, selling directly vs. through a cloud marketplace to save time and effort in the procurement process, and how the skillset required to be an SDR, SA, and Sales Reps have evolved over the last 10 years."
