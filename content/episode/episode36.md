Description = "Dr. Santona Tuli started her career as a physics researcher at CERN where she analyzed what happens when you slam large ions into one another.  Working with the vast amounts of data generated by those experiments inspired her to want to work in the data analysis space, so she became a Staff Data Scientist at Astronomer (a commercially managed Apache AirFlow vendor) and now she is the Head of Data at Upsolver where she helps build solutions for processing large amounts of streaming data in real time. Dr. Tuli was also featured in the IMAX documentary Secrets of the Universe. In this episode we discuss her time as a research scientist and how they use similar ways of tracking research goals that corporations do, like milestones and OKRs. She tells us about her experience with using custom built scientific software versus existing open source solutions like MongoDB and Apache AirFlow. Then we talk about her Grand Unified Theory of Batch and Streaming Data Processing, and how Upsolver is helping customers do both of those in one platform. Finally we discuss a bit about her experience being featured in the IMAX documentary Secrets of the Universe."
