Episode #20 of "Can I get that software in blue?", a podcast by and for people engaged in technology sales. If you are in the technology presales, solution architecture, sales, support or professional services career paths then this show is for you!

Today's episode is a little different, as we'll be talking about art and its intersection with technology. Your hosts Steve Mayzak and Chad Tindel are first joined by Rory Trifon, President of the Richard Bernstein Estate. Richard Bernstein is most widely remembered today as the creator of Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine distinctive covers and he was also a Pop Art pioneer, one of the first to blur the lines between commercial and fine art.

After that there is a short segment to showcase Bobby Zeik, an innovative artist doing really interesting work with spray paint, and he talks about his inspirations as well as his process for getting the work onto canvas.
