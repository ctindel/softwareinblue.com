Episode #24 of "Can I get that software in blue?", a podcast by and for people engaged in technology sales. If you are in the technology presales, solution architecture, sales, support or professional services career paths then this show is for you!

William Dinkel talks with us about his experience launching and shutting down one startup, then hitting it big with Nova.ai, which was one of the early successful AI sales tools years ago before all the ChatGPT-inspired hype hit recently, and getting acquired by Highspot. He tells us the real details on what it's like to startup a company, go through multiple incubators, get acquired, and integrate the product into a much larger suite of sales tools at Highspot.
