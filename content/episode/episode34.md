Description = "Shane is a deep expert in the search and indexing space having started his career at Autonomy working on early search indexing algorithms and setting up solutions for customers before and after the HP acqusition, later leading Product for the Elasticsearch side of the Elastic product suite. Now he's Head of Product at Vectara building out the next generation of semantic search and retrieval augmented generation platforms.  In this episode we touch on benchmarks for gauging the relative performance of difference search algorithms and how it applies to LLMs for doing things like preventing hallucinations in generative AI, what kinds of questions Elasticsearch customers were asking that led Shane to believe that vector based algorithms were the future for doing next generation semantic search, and why he believes Vectara is building the top tier solution to solve these problems."

Episode #34 of "Can I get that software in blue?", a podcast by and for people engaged in technology sales. If you are in the technology presales, solution architecture, sales, support or professional services career paths then this show is for you!

If you want to get into building AI products, first go to school and learn about antenna design! At least, that's how our guest for episode 34, Shane Connelly did it.

Shane is a deep expert in the search and indexing space having started his career at Autonomy working on early search indexing algorithms and setting up solutions for customers before and after the HP acqusition, later leading Product for the Elasticsearch side of the Elastic product suite. Now he's Head of Product at Vectara building out the next generation of semantic search and retrieval augmented generation platforms. 

In this episode we touch on benchmarks for gauging the relative performance of difference search algorithms and how it applies to LLMs for doing things like preventing hallucinations in generative AI, what kinds of questions Elasticsearch customers were asking that led Shane to believe that vector based algorithms were the future for doing next generation semantic search, and why he believes Vectara is building the top tier solution to solve these problems.
