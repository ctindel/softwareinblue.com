Episode #7 of "Can I get that software in blue?", a podcast by and for people engaged in technology sales. If you are in the technology presales, solution architecture, sales, support or professional services career paths then this show is for you!  

Your hosts Steve Mayzak and Chad Tindel are joined by Brent Holden, VP and Field CTO at Hashicorp and formerly the Chief Architect for Red Hat North America Commercial. We're also joined at the beginning by Dr. Chase Armer, President of Planned Solutions. Chase is both a Certified Financial Planner and a Chartered Financial Analyst. We start off the episode with a Peloton 10K breakdown and then dive into the role of a Field CTO, how it differs from the Solution Architect Role, Brent's view of the different cloud providers and some funny stories from Brent's life.

Brent did drop this golden nugget: When talking with an executive, give the summary up front instead of at the end!
