According to Rasmus, \"We see Bucket as a love story between Product and Engineering, a tool where CTOs and CPOs can come together and have a conversation about what's working in the product and what isn't\". Bucket is a tool designed to help SaaS companies track and evaluate features much more quickly than the usual months-long product feedback cycle that goes through sales teams and customer feedback. Come hear Rasmus' hot takes on why he thinks startups shouldn't have a free tier and how he approaches pricing decisions when launching new products."
